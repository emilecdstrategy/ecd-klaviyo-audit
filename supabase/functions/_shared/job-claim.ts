// Owning one step of an audit_analysis_jobs row, atomically.
//
// Both analysis pipelines (Klaviyo and web) run as a chain of short
// invocations, and several things can start one: the server chain itself, the
// profile-scan finish, the watchdog, and the browser tab watching progress.
// They used to read the row, check "not running", and then write "running" as
// separate steps. Two kicks landing within a second both passed the check, and
// from then on the two runs stayed in lockstep: the slower one's "pending" write
// cleared the faster one's "running" marker, which let its next step through
// too. 3 of 12 Klaviyo analyses ran every AI call twice (HigherDose on
// 2026-09-02 made 13 calls where 7 were needed), and the losing run left its
// row on "pending" for good, which the watchdog then re-kicked every five
// minutes, forever.
//
// The fix is a compare-and-set. Postgres re-checks an UPDATE's WHERE clause
// after taking the row lock, so of two runners asking to move step N from
// pending to running, exactly one gets a row back. The winner holds a random
// token, and every later write about that step is conditional on it: a runner
// that has lost the step can no longer overwrite the one that holds it.
